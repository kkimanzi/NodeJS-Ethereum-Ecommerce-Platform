# NodeJS-Ethereum-Ecommerce-Platform
**Summary**
Blockchain is a promising technology to solving some of the challenges faced by traditional e-commerce. Security of confidential consumer and company data, political and geographical restrictions, traceability and accountability to shareholders, and higher levies on transactions are problems faced in traditional e-commerce. This provides an opportunity for a platform based on blockchain to be used to provide accountability and traceability to shareholders due to immutability of data, lower the charges levied on transaction, while facilitating payment via crypto-currency that tackles the challenges of political and geographical retractions.
Development of the project was based on Ethereum, using Solidity to code the smart contract at the heart of this project. Mappings were found to be important data structures in the development of state variables to hold business and purchases information. Solidity’s modifiers came in handy in providing access control to parties making use of the platform. Ganache was used to create a local Ethereum network on which the smart contract was tested and deployed using Truffle. A client was created to interact with the smart contract from the browse by leveraging on Web3.js, and creating a server via Node.js. HTML, JavaScript and CSS were extensively used in the development of the client.
The platform so developed was able to allow a merchant to register their business on the platform. A user could view a list of the businesses registered on the platform. The specific businesses owned under shareholding of a particular user could be viewed independently of the entire inventory of businesses registered on the platform. A merchant was able to add a shareholder to their business, allowing them to view the transaction histories and balances related to that business. The merchant could withdraw funds held in escrow by the platform into their wallets.
Evaluation of the project revealed that the primary objectives set out by the project had been met. A few areas, however, were found where future work could be done on the project, including: improvement on the UX/UI, analytics functions and penetration testing of the smart contract
